This projet was created for the purpose to aid me in understanding the whats & hows of creating a React web application.

## Introduction

As of mid 2018, I have begun my journey towards becoming a better JavaScript developer. In order for this goal to be achievable, I needed to learn new frameworks to better prepare myself for the future. I do not claim to be an expert of the field of any technology, not even when I am asked during an interview process. And because of this reason, I can use it as a motivation to learn new technologies.

Today I expand my knowledge adding React into my brains memory.

Below you will find the links of the relevant sites, references and ect that aided me in creating this application and most importantly to keep track of the steps of my evolution:

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
react-for-fun/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
  src/
```

## NPM Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
